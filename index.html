     <p> New Delhi: The municipal body chief of Gujarat's Morbi city where a cable bridge snapped on Sunday, killing 135, was questioned by the police for four hours today.
        Sandeepsinh Zala, the municipal corporation boss, was asked to explain the fine print of the agreement signed with Gujarat-based watchmaker Oreva to renovate the century-old cable bridge.
        
        Documents listed in a local court that is looking into the tragedy show that the contractors hired for the renovation job were not qualified for such work. The subcontractor only painted and polished the cables for renovation. The same firm, although unqualified, had been given a contract in 2007 as well.New Delhi: The municipal body chief of Gujarat's Morbi city where a cable bridge snapped on Sunday, killing 135, was questioned by the police for four hours today.
